# LIST OF DISCOVERED ISSUES:
 1. Re-login does not save the set condition of the tasks with same account.
 2. After kill app, the set condition of the tasks is not saved.
 3. "Sort by name" does not work correctly (sometimes it can set the tasks as "Done").
 4. "Complete all", "Cancel all" do not work correctly (sometimes the color of text of tasks is getting as in "Done" state, but checkboxes are empty; sometimes the button is not changed into another).
 5. Single set task as "Done" does not work correctly (sometimes it marks another task, not the tasked i chose, as "Done").
 6. Retry pop-up error during login via valid credentials. No logical reproductions were found, everything is random.
 7. There is no safe range for entering characters into "Email" and "Password" fields. Current minimum - 1 character, maximum - unlimited. For example, valid range in Gmail is 6 - 30 characters for email field and 8 - 100 for password field. In Yahoo, valid range is 4 - 32 characters for email field and 9 - 128 for password field.
 8. Improvement, not a bug. Structure the pop-up window in the app. Make one form, text size, same font, buttons. In the login form screen two pop-ups look like system ones and differ from the Logout pop-up.
